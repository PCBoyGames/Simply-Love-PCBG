# Simply Love PCBG

Welcome to Simply Love PCBG, the custom Stepmania theme (as an offroot of Dan Guzek's Simply Love "recreation" for SM5) I made for me, a semi-mid level, multi-controller player.

The files given here include my noteskin and the theme. As such, you are going to need to extract a downloaded .zip in the root directory.

The current version is preliminary, and more features have yet to be added.

Rainbow mode is currently not compatible, nor are visual themes other than Heart and Arrow. I need to make changes to those when I get time to.

My keyboard play mods are set by default, with the exception of a few second page settings. If you want to change them, you will need a Stepmania in-game profile so that my mods are not set back automatically after each session you play a different setting scheme.

This theme contains features intended for SM5.1 (currently beta), and thus is only for it. Although it might look to work at first, it will not in SM5.0.12 or Etterna, as some of the mods linked in the player option menu metrics are not in these versions. You can get any beta of SM5.1 at https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases.

My theme falls under the same licensing as the original.
